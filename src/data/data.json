I learned to master key technologies such as HTML, CSS, and SASS, and to apply them in creating effective web designs. My experience in the course also enabled me to develop skills in using tools like Flexbox, Grids, and Bootstrap, which facilitated the creation of complex and responsive layouts. Additionally, I learned to manipulate pseudo-classes and create dynamic animations that enhance the user experience.A fundamental aspect of my training was the introduction to Git and GitHub, which allowed me to understand the importance of version control and collaboration in web development projects. I also acquired basic knowledge of search engine optimization (SEO) and web security (KYC).",

This course enabled me to develop solid skills in JavaScript, allowing me to create dynamic and efficient web applications. I learned to control cycles and control structures, create and use functions, manipulate arrays and objects, and apply object-oriented and functional programming concepts. I also acquired knowledge about DOM manipulation and events in the browser, as well as asynchronous HTTP requests. I learned to use promises and external libraries to improve the efficiency and scalability of my applications.

We understood the terms Mission, Vision, and Purpose of a company, developing a Point of View (POV) and, based on the collected data and its analysis, we designed an application to solve the problem. We worked user-centered, using standardized techniques to define 'User Personas,' generate an empathy map, and finally find a solution with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).This course aimed to help us understand the different stages for 'ideating' an application, from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes. I also performed Card Sorting and Dendrograms to determine the adequate information structure. I used Taskflow and Userflow to define the various tasks encompassed by the app.The color selection respected the WCAG 2.0 guidelines (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), and we used 'Adobe Color' to verify that the color relationship between text and background was optimal. We created a logo for the product and finally conducted a Heuristic Evaluation, Executive Summary, and Efficacy Metrics.The final product was well-received by the evaluating team, who were very satisfied with the research process but not as much with the final design, as it was not aligned with the latest trends. That's why, in my next project, you'll find a redesign of my 'Community for Mobile' project.",
